Move to ngspice_sync/ng_shared_parallel_v/Release/ and start
ng_shared_parallel_v.exe.

Compilation (tested with MS Visual Studio 2008) is available by 
activating ng_shared_parallel_v.sln in ngspice_sync/ng_shared_parallel_v/.

Compilation with CYGWIN is o.k. as well. You have to manually copy 
usr/local/bin/cygngspice-0.dll to cygngspice-x.dll with x = 1, 2, 3.

Compilation under LINUX still has to be tested.
